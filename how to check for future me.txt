- look if the current colour King is in check
  - To do this find all the checking squares the other colour occupies
  - See if the origin of the king is in one of those squares then apply the check thing
  - restrict the king moves bacilly say there is a same colour pice there so king cant go there so casling dosen't happen through check

- blocking check
- if king in check find a move that intersects with the check squares
  - See if there is a peice there dose it block check
  - if yes add it to the only move they can do
  - if not make the current square the only move

- Make that the only move that they can do
 - do this for all the pecies
- After move is done clear the legal move list

- Taking to remove check
- Tag what peice is checking the king
 - shoot out a queen move style beams and knight
 - if the line is intersected by a black peice see what peicce that is
 - add that peice to the checking list
 - If there is more than one peice checking the king
 - Taking for check will never happen
 - if there is 1 peice checking
   - see if one of the peices can take it and if it can add it to the list of legal moves

- Check Mate
  - if there is no moves except for the origin that the curret colour can do then it is the end of the game and check mate
